# TLID-Dataset
Towards Defect Detection of Transmission Line Insulator.


The TLID dataset is a publicly available dataset released by the Power Vision Research Center of the School of Artificial Intelligence at North China Electric Power University （NCEPU）. This dataset includes detailed images of insulator defect samples from multiple backgrounds and materials. We hope that these works can assist researchers engaged in this field.
